  You will be able to play your favourite games with established play-to-earn
projects and increase your chances of winning big prizes… but Metacade is much more than just a place to play. In the
Metacade platform, you will be able to meet fellow gamers, developers and entrepreneurs who want to share their
interests, ideas, skills, and talents with one common goal.

You will be able to see what games are trending, view leaderboards, publish reviews, gain access to the most advanced GameFi alpha and interact with other members in real-time - all whilst being rewarded with the native $MCADE token for your own input into the community. We want to put games back into the hands of gamers, and that is why $MCADE token holders will be able to vote on which developer-submitted games will receive funding via our Metagrants scheme. Web3 technology is revolutionising how the world functions and Metacade will revolutionise how a traditional community gaming hub is operated and owned. Join us in our journey to create an arcade built by gamers, for gamers.

# Q&A section

<details>

  <summary>
    What is a presale?
  </summary>

A presale is a token sale event that occurs before an actual coin/token launch in which the general public can
participate. The presale fundraising targets are often lower than the main Coin launch event.
This allows retail buyers to purchase a token at an early-bird price before it goes public. Therefore, presale can be
considered a potential opportunity to buy tokens or coins before they are released into circulation and listed on
exchanges

    What is the main goal of the Metacade platform?
  </summary>

To create the most fun, dynamic virtual hangout for like-minded people where they can enjoy all things GameFi. We are
building the world’s first community-developed P2E blockchain arcade for you to experience everything that Web3 culture
has to offer.

On the Metacade platform, you can meet fellow entrepreneurs, game developers, and blockchain enthusiasts who want to
share their interests, ideas, and talents.

_Our goal_ is to make Metacade a self-sustainable platform and use the platform to reward the community through an innovative token staking mechanism. We also intend to build a treasury reserve that can be used to develop the strengths of the Metacade community and enhance the future of blockchain gaming.

  <summary>What measures are in place to ensure my tokens are protected?</summary>
  
  To achieve maximum security for $MCADE and its holders, we submitted Metacade – its specification, smart contract, and
team – for a CertiK audit to assess its fundamentals and ensure its code and roadmap measure up to the high standards
required in Web3.
CertiK is one of the industry leaders in blockchain security and transparency. Using cutting-edge auditing methodology
and mathematics, supported by a team of top engineers, CertiK carried out a custom, thorough and transparent audit to
identify code errors and potential risks to ensure Metacade is protected and works as intended. Additionally, CertiK
performed a full KYC check & interview with all senior team members.
You can always be sure about the transparency of all the actions and transactions made using the Metacade token.

  Client fund protection and safety is one of our top priorities. Below are a few risk management practices we have in
place for the $MCADE token holders:
A fully audited, multisig wallet to protect client tokens from hackers.
Management of treasury assets done by multiple keyholders. Two or more private key signatures are required to make a
